    "The goal of this notebook is to evaluate the embeddings that we have created. Specifically, we are interested in how well (both qualitative and quantitatively) our embeddings do at matching questions with context in the statement portion of the earnings call transcript. Since we divided the statements portion of each earnings call transcript into chunks of size at most 64 words, this reduces to matching each question with the statement chunk that is most \"similar\" in terms of some predefined similarity metric (e.g. cosine similarity)."
